This focus of this project is to create an open C/C++ library for processing raw EEG data.  Our current testbed is the Emotiv EPOC, which we are currently attempting to decipher.

Renderer uses the Qt C++ Language extension so make sure you get that first.  Then run the following commands

qmake -project
qmake
Add -ludev and -lcrypto to LIBS in Makefile
make

If Makefile is already there just run make

Required libraries:
Udev
Openssl

People Who's code we borrowed : 
Alan Ott - udev stuff
jrupac - getting openssl to work
